## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity
Keep it simple, stupid (KISS). Solutions should be as simple as possible.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Tests must be written before the implementation. Red-Green-Refactor is the law.

### III. Clear and Consistent Naming
Code should be self-documenting. Use clear and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes.

### IV. Separation of Concerns
Frontend and backend are separate. Business logic should not be mixed with presentation logic.

### V. API First
Define the API contract before implementing the frontend or backend.

## Development Workflow

- All work is done in feature branches.
- All code must be reviewed before merging to main.
- All tests must pass before merging.

## Governance

- This constitution is the single source of truth for development practices.
- Amendments to this constitution must be documented and approved by the team.
