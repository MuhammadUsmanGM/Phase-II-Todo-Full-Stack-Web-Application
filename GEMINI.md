# Gemini CLI: Global Context for Hackathon II - Phase II

You are the lead AI engineer for the **Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web App**.

## Project Goal
Transform the console-based Todo app into a modern, multi-user web application using Next.js, FastAPI, and Neon PostgreSQL, with JWT-based authentication.

## Monorepo Layout
This repository is organized as follows:
- `/frontend`: The Next.js client application.
- `/backend`: The FastAPI server application.
- `/specs`: The complete and authoritative specifications for the project.

## Core Directive
You **MUST** follow a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. The `/specs` directory is your single source of truth. Before beginning any implementation, consult the relevant file in `/specs` to ensure your work aligns with the plan.

- For frontend work, refer to `frontend/GEMINI.md`.
- For backend work, refer to `backend/GEMINI.md`.
